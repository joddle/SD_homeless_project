<p><em>Five years of monthly geographic positions for homeless sleepers in Downtown San Diego</em></p>
<p>This dataset provides geographic locations for homeless sleepers in Downtown San Diego, as counted by enumerators from the Downtown San Diego Partnership. These counts have been done monthly since 2012, and this dataset provides counts since 2014. </p>

Sleepers.png" width="400px"></a></center></p>
<p>The count is done on paper maps with handwritten count marks. The San Diego
Regional Data Library's <a href="http://downtown-homelessness.sandiegodata.org/">Downton Homelessness
project</a> converted these
scanned count maps using a <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/">web based image annotation
tool</a>.</p>
<h2>Base and Imputed Datasets</h2>
<p>This distribution has two version of the homeless counts, the base set,
<code>homeless_counts</code>, which has three months of missing data, and the imputed
dataset, <code>imputed_counts</code> in which these three missing months, 2014-08,
2014-09, and 2015-06 are probabilistically re-created.</p>
<p>The Imputation process uses the total count for the month, from the
<code>monthly_totals</code> dataset, as the number of sleepers that the imputed month
will have. Then, the imputation process collects at least 1,000 records with
dates near the missing month into a sample set, calculating the portion of
records that are in each census block. Then the algorithm randomly selects that
number of records for each census block, and adjusts random blocks so the total
of the whole set of selected records is equal to the official count for the
month.</p>
<p>The result is an imputed month that has the same number of records as the
official count for the month and as the same portion of sleepers in each census
block as in adjacent months.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Notes for the source dataset, as of April 2019:</p>
<p>The preliminary methodology (shown in yellow) [ March 2017 and earlier] counted
two individuals per tent and two individuals per vehicle.</p>
<p>On April 27, 2017, the Clean &amp; Safe program adopted the counting methodology
used by the Regional Task Force on the Homeless. Per the methodology
(represented above by the dark green cells), [April 2017 to April 2018,
inclusive ] Clean &amp; Safe staff counted 1.75 individuals per visible
tent/structure and 1.66 individuals per vehicle that showed clear signs of
habitation.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the Regional Task Force on the Homeless updated the methodology
for vehicles to 2.03 that shows clear signs of habitation (the methodology of
1.75 individuals per tent/structure remained the same). The Clean &amp; Safe
program implemented this methodology on May 31, 2018 (represented in orange).</p>
<p>* Denotes the months that The Downtown Fellowship of Ministries and Churches collaborated with us on the monthly homeless sleep count.</p>
<p>**East Village breakout areas include the following:
    * North East East Village is the area north of Market Street &amp; east of Park Ave. 
    * North West is the area north of Market Street &amp; west of Park Ave.
    * South East is the area east of Park Ave. south of Market Street
    * South West is the area west of Park Ave. south of Market Street</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Because this data is extracted, manually, from manually recorded maps, there
are a lot of quality issues. </p>
<h3>Missing Months</h3>
<p>Because of conversion errors and some complications with the source maps, there
are several months of data that are excluded from this dataset</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>August 2014</strong>. In the original datasets, August 2014 was a duplicate of September 2014. </li>
<li><strong>September 2014</strong>. Comfusion related to the duplication of September and August resulted in September being incompletely processed. </li>
<li><strong>June 2015</strong>. All of the map images for this month were blank. An alternate source PDF exists that is not blank, but this file was not used.     </li>
</ul>
<p>These months are re-created, probabilistically, in the <code>imputed_counts</code>
dataset.</p>
<h3>Not Using Ocupancy Multipliers</h3>
<p>Since about 2017, HUD has instructed point-in-time homeless counts to multiply
the counts of sleepers in structures and vehicles by factors to account for
people who may be obsured and not directly countable. From April 2017 on,
Downtown San Diego Partnership has been using these factors.</p>
<p>However, this dataset does not use the occupancy factors, to allow analysts to
apply these factors consistently across all months of data. As a result, the
counts from this dataset diverge from the official counts after March 2017.</p>
<h3>Other Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>total_count</code> often does not match the sum of counts on the map. These sums were made by hand, by the enumerator who made the counts, so there are occasional arithmetic errors.  </li>
<li>There are many instances of missing values for <code>rain</code> or <code>temp</code></li>
<li>Some dates include the day of the month, but many don't These dates have a day of month of 1.</li>
<li>Date day of month is generally unreliable. Only the year and month are reliable, except for files noted above. </li>
<li>The <code>neighborhood</code> value is based on the map names, so in some months
  the East Village neighborhood is separated into <code>east_village</code> and <code>east_village_south</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison to Official Published Counts</h3>
<p>This plot shows, per month, the offical published counts from San Diego
Downtown Partnership versus the total from this dataset. Note the descrepancies
dues to issues noted above, including missing months, minor differences in some
months, and the divergence after March 2017 due to occupancy multiplers.</p>
